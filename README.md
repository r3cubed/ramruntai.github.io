Thank you for your interests and enthusiasm which I didn't expect. 
Our regular meeting will start in August with prayers and careful planning.
Please pay attention to the annoucements from our organizational committee.
Before we start our meetings, please try the following things, making yourself familiar with 
them.

1. Read carefully an introductory python book. 
   - To some of you, I already recommened "Think Python: How to Think like a computer scientist"
   Vist https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html and you will find a free pdf version.
   The author Allen B. Downey wrote many good books including this one.
1. Anaconda
   - https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
   - Please install anaconda and download/install packages as needed.
   - Make yourself familiar with the package management.
   - Annaconda includes Ipython and man
1. Jupyter notebook
   - In your anaconda, jupyter notebook can be installed.
1. For any questions on programming and tools
   - https://stackoverflow.com/
1. Github: you are here.
